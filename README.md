# WBE-monitoring-for-COVID-19
Wastewater-based modeling, reconstruction, and prediction for COVID-19 outbreaks in Hungary using optimization

For copyright reasons, wastewater measurements are not uploaded here, instead, a computer generated daily sequence is used to illustrate the computations. The computer generated wastewater curve more-or-less follows the actual epidemic curves occured in Hungary.

Other COVID data (hospital load, confirmed cases, stringency index, vaccination, etc.) are downloaded in February 2023 from the repositry [1] published by the team of Our World in Data (OWID).

Methodology
-----------

The computations are based on our previous works [2-4] and an on-going research project [5].
