Wastewater-based modeling, reconstruction, and prediction for COVID-19 outbreaks in Hungary using optimization

For copyright reasons, wastewater measurements are not uploaded here, instead, a computer generated daily sequence is used to illustrate the computations. The computer generated wastewater curve more-or-less follows the actual epidemic curves occured in Hungary.
